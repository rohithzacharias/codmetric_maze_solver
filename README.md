# codmetric_maze_solver
A Python-based maze solver that uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from start to end in a grid-based maze. Developed as part of the Codmetric AI Internship.
# Codmetric Maze Solver 🧱🔍

This project is a simple **maze-solving program** developed using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in Python. The goal is to find the **shortest path** from a start point `S` to an endpoint `E` in a grid-based maze.

It was built as part of the **Codmetric AI Internship** to demonstrate foundational graph traversal and pathfinding concepts.

---

## 💡 Features
- Solves any rectangular maze represented as a 2D grid
- Uses **BFS**, ensuring the **shortest path** is found
- Supports obstacles (walls) and open paths
- Cleanly prints the solved path

---

## 🔢 Maze Legend
- `S` – Start
- `E` – End
- `#` – Wall
- `' '` – Walkable path
- `*` – Solution path (optional output)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard libraries: `collections`, `copy`

---
